== Changes since Gun 1.3

The following patch versions were released since Gun 1.3:

=== Gun 1.3.3

This release updates Erlang.mk to include features useful
to RabbitMQ.

It also updates Cowlib to 2.7.0.

=== Gun 1.3.2

This release backports a fix that will be included in the
upcoming Gun 2.0 release:

* Gun will now properly identify HTTP/2 preface errors,
  for example when attempting to connect to an HTTP/1.1
  server or a non-HTTP server. Gun will give a different
  error message when it thinks it received an HTTP/1.1
  response.

=== Gun 1.3.1

This release backports a fix that will be included in the
upcoming Gun 2.0 release:

* *POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY*: Fix transfer-encoding
  precedence over content-length in responses. This bug may
  contribute to a response smuggling security vulnerability
  when Gun is used inside a proxy.
